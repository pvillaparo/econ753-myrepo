# DYNAMICS
## RUST 1987
Estimation model evaluates convergence on EValue. 
Note that choices here discrete, 

## Hotz and Miller

- replace EV with choice probabilities, so we don't do contracting mapping for every guess of the parameters
- find EV using this logit algrebra that can express EV as a funciton of the data.
- In this case is only a difference not with weights.
- but CCP is not asymptotically efficient

... moving to handwrited notes now ...
